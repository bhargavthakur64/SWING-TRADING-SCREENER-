# Equal-Weighted Sector Watchlist Screener 

A high-performance financial analytics web application designed for active swing traders. It loads sector watchlists containing **288 stocks** across **11 sectors**, pulls historical price data, computes a **true equal-weighted portfolio NAV**, calculates key exponential moving averages (20, 50, 200 EMA) for trend identification, and displays the result on a dark-themed responsive dashboard powered by the official **TradingView Lightweight Charts** engine.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **True Equal-Weighted NAV Calculation**:
   - Eliminates price-weighted biases. Each stock's price is normalized to a base value of 100 on your selected start date:
     Pᵢ,ₜⁿᵒʳᵐ = Pᵢ,ₜ / Pᵢ,ₜ₀ × 100
- The overall portfolio NAV is calculated daily as the mathematical average of these normalized stock prices:
  NAVₜ = (1 / Nₜ) ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺₜ Pᵢ,ₜⁿᵒʳᵐ
   - This ensures a 10% move in a ₹100 stock carries the exact same weight as a 10% move in a ₹2,000 stock.

2. **Official TradingView Charts (v5.2.0)**:
   - Integrates the high-performance canvas-rendered **TradingView Lightweight Charts** library.
   - Supports intuitive browser controls:
     - **Mouse Drag-Pan**: Hold and drag left/right to scroll the timeline, or drag up/down to scroll the canvas.
     - **Mouse Wheel / Trackpad Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out of the dates timeline.
     - **Y-Axis Scale Dragging**: Click and drag the right-side price axis scale up/down to compress or stretch the price y-axis manually.
     - **Reset View**: Click the **Reset Zoom** button in the header toolbar to fit all data back to the default viewport immediately.

3. **Multi-Sector Watchlist Dropdown**:
   - Toggle instantly between 11 sectors parsed from your watchlist database.
   - Quick filtering of watchlist stocks using the sidebar search box.

4. **Floating Analytics Cards**:
   - **Periodic Returns Table**: Calculates real-time portfolio performance across standard periods (1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month, 1 Year, etc.).
   - **Holdings Table**: Displays current stock prices, period rate of change (ROC%), and relative outperformance/underperformance vs. the basket NAV (vs. NAV%).

5. **Local Offline-First Support**:
   - Built-in static copies of React, ReactDOM, Babel, and Lightweight Charts are served directly from the `/static` folder. No reliance on external CDNs ensures ultra-fast offline page load speeds.
